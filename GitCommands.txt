You can switch between version with git checkout without problems. Just don't try to change and save anything.

This will show what branch you are on, what untracked files you have and which files have been changed 
compared to 'HEAD'

git add lesson_1_reflections.txt
This will add the file of your choice to the staging area. So that you can commit the stage.
