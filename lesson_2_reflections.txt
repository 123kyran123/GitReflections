1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates an hidden folder .git with the information it needs for a repository.
You need this folder any interaction with git and the files. Like committing them.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and repository? What value do you think it offers?
You add the files you want to commit to the staging area.
It means that the amount of files in the staging area isn't the same as in the directory.
It allows you to store more related files in the working directory without them being commited as well.
